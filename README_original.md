Personal Polymarket
--


This web application will be for me and a few friends to bet on my life events like Polymarket. 

1) We'll need a backend and frontend. Please give a suggestion of a generous free tier for hosting both and build based on that. 
2) Users should be able to add a name and automatically get 100 dollars. Names can be deleted, and no password is needed, so users should just 'log in' with a unique name. 
3) Users should also be able to create events for others to see. 
4) Design a fun front-end that doesn't look AI generated. Users should be able to see the current percentage of each market and a timeline. Make a sample market like 'will eat a whole package of turkey straight from the box'
